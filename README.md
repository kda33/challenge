# About The CI Challenge

In this challenge, I set up a repository and CI pipeline on GitHub that, upon a repository code change, builds and tests a set of microservices, then deploys docker images to an DockerHub repository.

## Built With

* ![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/docker-%230db7ed.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
* ![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/flask-%23000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white)
* ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54)

## Prerequisites

Basic knowledge of Flask, Python, Docker and CURL.
Python installed on your system
Build Flask app in docker image
Setting Up the Parallel Jobs
To set up the parallel jobs, you can define each job as a separate step in a YAML file.

### About the challenge

- [x] Create 3 microservices (Flask): microservice_a, microservice_b, and microservice_c.
- [x] Create a script (Python) that tests each microservice by sending it an HTTP request.
- [x] When the test script sends an HTTP request to microservice_a or microservice_b, it should succeed with a 200 response code.
- [x] When the test script sends an HTTP request to microservice_c, it should fail with a 500 response code.
- [ ] Each microservice should have a script (bash, etc.) that builds its docker image. 
- [x] The pipeline should build these docker images in parallel. 
If any docker image fails to build successfully, then the pipeline should fail.
- [x] Once the docker images are built, use the test script to send HTTP requests to each microservice. This should result in microservice_a and microservice_b passing, but microservice_c failing.
- [x] Deploy the passing docker images to the image repository.
Conclude the CI pipeline with the appropriate status.

### Build the docker image

To build the docker image, the GitHub module was taken instead of the script, thereby reducing the human factor and improving the readability of the code.
